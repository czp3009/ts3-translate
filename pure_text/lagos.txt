<p><strong>Push-To-Talk</strong> will only enable your microphone when your assigned hotkey is pressed and deactivate the microphone when your assigned hotkey is released. Click on the &quot;No Hotkey Assigned&quot; button if you are configuring Push-To-Talk for the first time.</p>
<p>With <strong>Continuous Transmission</strong> voice data is constantly transmitted. It is recommended to use Push-To-Talk or Voice Activation Detection instead to lower bandwidth usage.</p>
<p><strong>Voice Activation Detection</strong> automatically detects your voice the moment you begin speaking (as well as when you stop speaking) and will enable or disable your microphone accordingly. This facilitates hands-free communication through TeamSpeak.</p><p>This method is not recommended in noisy environments since background noise may mistakenly be detected and transmitted to other users.</p>

Zero and all negative values cannot cause clipping and distortion, and are preferred for optimal audio quality.
Values greater than zero and less than +6 dB might cause moderate clipping and distortion, but should still be within acceptable bounds.
Values greater than +6 dB will cause clipping and distortion that will negatively affect your audio quality. It is advised to chose lower values.

<p>The required security level determines how long connecting users will have to improve their identity security level before their identity will be considered valid on to connect to this server, essentially reducing the potential for spam and abuse because once banned the abuser needs to invest a lot of time to create a new one.</p><p>Each increase in security level will require twice the average computation time on the client side. To give you a ballpark figure the average times to create an identity usually is within the following bounds:</p><p>Level 0-23 Generated in seconds<br>Level 23-29 Generated in minutes<br>Level 29-34 Generated in hours<br>Level 35-39 Generated in days<br>Level 40-43 Generated in months<br>Level 44++ Generated in years</p>
